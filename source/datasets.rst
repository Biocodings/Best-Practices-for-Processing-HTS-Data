Datasets
========
- Reference genome
	Analysis requires a number of reference datasets. A `ressource bundle
	<ftp://gsapubftp-anonymous@ftp.broadinstitute.org/bundle/>`_ 
	with all necessary files for the GATK workflow is provided by the Broad Institute.
	The link contains bundles for a number of different versions of the human reference genome; 
	in the NEXT bioinformatics network we use either b37 or Hg19. The two reference genomes are almost identical except for a few minor differences.

- Oncotator Annotation
	Instructions for downloading the Oncotator ressource files and installing the software can be found `here
